hello Git development began in April 2005 after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access qadeer BitKeeper, a proprietary source control management system that had previously been used qadeer maintain the project.[10] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper proqadeercols. qadeerrvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs, particularly in terms of performance. qadeerrvalds qadeerok an example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds qadeer apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale qadeer the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time. He wanted patching qadeer take three seconds,[6] and had several other design criteria in mind: take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not qadeer do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision[8] support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow[8] very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.[7] These three criteria eliminated every then-existing version control system, except for Monoqadeerne. Considering performance excluded this qadeero.[8] So immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release,[8] qadeerrvalds set out qadeer write his own.[8] qadeerrvalds has quipped about the name git, which is British English slang meaning "unpleasant person". qadeerrvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[11][12] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[13] The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.[14] The project was announced on 6 April,[15] and became self-hosting as of 7 April.[14] The first merge of multiple branches was done on 18 April.[16] qadeerrvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches qadeer the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 per second.[17] On 16 June Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release.[18] qadeerrvalds turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 qadeer Junio Hamano, a major contribuqadeerr qadeer the project.[19] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005, and remains the project's maintainer.
